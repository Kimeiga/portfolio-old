I think I should make a Jekyll portfolio site because I'm getting too bogged down trying to design a site from scratch and not spending enough time just writing copy for my site. 

Jekyll is very simple and extendible and reliable which are some great qualities. 

I'll just write a bunch of copy for all my projects here and then try working on a legit site later.
